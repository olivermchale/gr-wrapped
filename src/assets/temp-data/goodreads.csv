Games to escape, games to celebrate, games to compete, games to play. I also work as a programmer - the infinite gaming and technology references weren’t lost on me, and definitely made me smile (and even exhale sharply from my nose) whilst reading. I also coincidentally had a broken foot whilst reading this (as does one of this books main characters, Sam, which helped to make him even more relatable)<br/><br/>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow is a love story that isn’t a love story. It’s brutally real and raw. Life isn’t perfect - we don’t live in a made up, idealistic video game world - and Zevin fully explores that, taking us through the high highs and the low lows that reality forces us to embrace and endure. <br/><br/>This book is truly special, and will be one I will cherish fondly<br/><br/>5/5",,,1,0

I was really excited after thoroughly adoring Song of Achilles by the same author. <br/><br/>The book was beautifully written, with memorable, gorgeous quotes such as ‘No wonder I have been so slow, I thought. All this while I have been a weaver without wool, a ship without the sea. Yet now look where I sail.’ and ‘But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.’ <br/><br/>However, there was (to me) no clear direction which the book was taking. Perhaps I just prefer plot focused books, as this was obviously very much about building the Circe character and the hardships she went through to make her the person she is at the end of the book. I wasn’t looking forward to picking the book up, and wasn’t overly interested in seeing the next hardship she would face. <br/><br/>However, the beautiful writing made up for this, hence the 3 star review. I do look forward to Millers ‘Persephone’ and hope it’ll be more like SoA! ",true,,1,0
